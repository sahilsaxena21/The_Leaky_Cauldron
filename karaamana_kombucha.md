# Karaamana Kombucha Recipie

Add the following into the fermentation glass bottle:

**Ginger**: 1 tsp, grated or finely diced	1/2 tsp (use less if dry/powdered)

**Turmeric**: 1/2 tsp, grated or finely diced	1/4 tsp (use less if dry/powdered)

**Black Pepper**: 5-7 whole peppercorns, slightly crushed	Pinch (approx. 1/16 tsp)


**Instructions**

1. Prepare Flavoring: Grate or finely chop your fresh ginger and turmeric. Lightly crush the black peppercorns using the back of a spoon or a mortar and pestle to release the flavor.

2. Add to Bottle: Using a small funnel, add the prepared ginger, turmeric, and black pepper (and optional sweetener) to your clean, pressure-safe flip-top bottle.

3. Fill Bottle: Pour your finished raw kombucha from the First Fermentation (F1) into the bottle, leaving at least 1-2 inches of headspace at the top. This is crucial for pressure build-up.

4. Seal and Ferment: Seal the bottle tightly. Place it in a dark spot at room temperature (70°F–78°F / 21°C–25°C) for 2 to 5 days. The exact time depends on your room temperature and desired fizziness.

5. Monitor Carbonation: After 2 days, begin to check the carbonation by opening the bottle (a process called "burping"). If you hear a satisfying hiss, it's ready. If it's too fizzy, refrigerate immediately. If it's not fizzy enough, reseal and let it sit for another day.

6. Chill: Once the desired carbonation is reached, move the sealed bottles to the refrigerator. Chilling halts the fermentation process and preserves the carbonation.

7. Fill Bottles: Pour the raw kombucha from F1 into the bottles, leaving about an inch or two of headspace at the top.

8. Seal and Carbonate: Tightly seal the bottles. Place them back in a warm, dark spot for 2 to 5 days to build carbonation.

9. Burping (Optional but Recommended): In the first 2-3 days, you may need to "burp" the bottles once a day by briefly opening and closing the cap to release excess pressure and prevent potential bottle explosions.

10. Chill and Enjoy: Once the desired carbonation level is reached, transfer the sealed bottles to the refrigerator. Chilling stops the fermentation process. Enjoy the carbonated, flavored kombucha!
